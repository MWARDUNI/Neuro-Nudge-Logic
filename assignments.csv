The study of automata is foundational for understanding how problems can be mechanistically solved.</p></li><li><p><strong>Formal Languages and Grammars</strong>: This topic explores the formalisms used to describe and classify languages (sets of strings) that automata can recognize. It covers the Chomsky hierarchy, which classifies languages into types based on their generative grammars, from regular and context-free languages to context-sensitive and recursively enumerable languages.</p></li><li><p><strong>Computability Theory</strong>: Also known as recursion theory, computability theory addresses the question of what problems can be solved by algorithms, hence what is computable. It includes the study of recursive functions, the Church-Turing thesis, and the concept of undecidability, illustrated by famous problems like the Halting Problem.</p></li></ol>",CONFIRMED,0,6rvk2fggtj7mbh4p5ct4pclaul@google.com,,,DISPLAY,No category provided,TODO: via UID,0
