# Prepare Strategies:
# Develop study sheets or study guides
# Make flash cards
# Outline/summarize material
# Develop concept maps or charts (make sure you use use linking terms)
# List the steps in a complex process or develop a flow chart
# Make a list of 20 topics that could be on the exam. Be able to explain why you think they might be on the test.
# Predict (and answer!) practice test/essay questions
# Answer questions at the end of the chapter (that werenâ€™t assigned as HW)
# Prepare material for a study group


# Review Strategies:
# Explain concepts to others
# Use your quizlets or flash cards
# Work problems (no looking at answer keys!)
# Take self-tests (try to mimic test conditions if you can)
# Recite from memory (better yet, tell your cat or favorite pillow) your list of 20 topics that could be on the exam.
# Work the problems that you missed on quizzes, HW, or questions at the end of the chapter
# Outline answers to essay questions from memory
# Write a full sample essay
# Explain material to group members or study partners
