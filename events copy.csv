These systems are embedded as part of a larger device, system, or installation and typically have stringent requirements for size, power consumption, and reliability. The key characteristics and components of embedded systems programming include:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Microcontrollers and Microprocessors</strong>: The core of most embedded systems, these integrated circuits execute the software programmed into them. Microcontrollers include memory and peripherals on the same chip, making them ideal for direct control tasks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)</strong>: Many embedded systems require real-time performance, where tasks must be completed within strict time constraints. An RTOS manages the hardware resources and scheduling to meet these time requirements.</p></li><li><p><strong>Programming Languages</strong>: C and C++ are the most commonly used programming languages for embedded systems due to their efficiency and control over system resources. Assembly language is also used for very low-level programming, and newer languages like Rust are gaining traction for their safety features.</p></li><li><p><strong>Input/Output Interfaces</strong>: Embedded systems often interact with the external world through sensors and actuators. Programming these interfaces involves managing digital and analog inputs/outputs, communication protocols (e.g., SPI, I2C, UART), and sometimes complex signal processing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Power Management</strong>: Many embedded systems are battery-powered and require careful management of power consumption. Programming for power efficiency involves techniques such as sleep modes, dynamic power scaling, and efficient use of peripherals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Development Environments and Tools</strong>: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and tools specific to the target hardware are used for coding, debugging, and testing. These tools often include simulators, emulators, and real-time debugging features.</p></li><li><p><strong>Security</strong>: With the rise of connected devices, security has become a critical aspect of embedded systems programming. This includes implementing secure boot, encryption, secure communication protocols, and regular security updates.</p></li><li><p><strong>Testing and Debugging</strong>: Due to the hardware-software integration and the specific applications of embedded systems, testing and debugging can be complex. This often involves hardware-in-the-loop simulations, unit testing, and extensive field testing.</p></li></ol><br><table><thead><tr><th><strong><b>Item</b></strong></th><th><strong><b>Weight</b></strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Midterm Exam</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Final Exam</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>HW / Lab Assignments</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Class Project</td><td>40%<br></td></tr></tbody></table>    <br><span>Letter Grade Distribution</span><br><table><thead><tr><th><strong><b>Range</b></strong></th><th><strong><b>Letter Grade</b></strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Total Score ≥ 90%</td><td>    A</td></tr><tr><td>90% &gt; Total Score ≥ 85%</td><td>    B+</td></tr><tr><td>85% &gt; Total Score ≥ 80%</td><td>    B</td></tr><tr><td>80% &gt; Total Score ≥ 75%</td><td>    C+</td></tr><tr><td>75% &gt; Total Score ≥ 70%</td><td>    C</td></tr><tr><td>70% &gt; Total Score ≥ 65%</td><td>    D+</td></tr><tr><td>65% &gt; Total Score ≥ 60%</td><td>    D</td></tr><tr><td>60% &gt; Total Score</td><td>    F</td></tr></tbody></table>",No category provided,CONFIRMED,,1hjt21vpaq149h4djgmcheidre@google.com,,,DISPLAY,0,0,"vRecur({'FREQ': ['WEEKLY'], 'WKST': ['SU'], 'UNTIL': [datetime.datetime(2024, 5, 10, 5, 59, 59, tzinfo=<UTC>)], 'BYDAY': ['MO', 'WE']})"

It is a core area of computer science that intersects with mathematics, logic, and algorithms, providing a theoretical framework for understanding the capabilities and limitations of computing machines. The course is essential for students interested in the deeper theoretical aspects of computer science, including algorithms, complexity theory, and the nature of computation itself. Here's an overview of the key topics and components typically covered:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Automata Theory</strong>: This area introduces the concept of automata as abstract models of computing machines. Students learn about finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines, which correspond to different classes of computational problems. The study of automata is foundational for understanding how problems can be mechanistically solved.</p></li><li><p><strong>Formal Languages and Grammars</strong>: This topic explores the formalisms used to describe and classify languages (sets of strings) that automata can recognize. It covers the Chomsky hierarchy, which classifies languages into types based on their generative grammars, from regular and context-free languages to context-sensitive and recursively enumerable languages.</p></li><li><p><strong>Computability Theory</strong>: Also known as recursion theory, computability theory addresses the question of what problems can be solved by algorithms, hence what is computable. It includes the study of recursive functions, the Church-Turing thesis, and the concept of undecidability, illustrated by famous problems like the Halting Problem.</p></li><li><p><strong>Complexity Theory</strong>: This area examines the resources (such as time and space) required to solve computational problems and classifies problems based on their inherent difficulty. Key concepts include P vs. NP, NP-completeness, and various complexity classes like P, NP, EXP, and space complexity classes like PSPACE.</p></li><li><p><strong>Algorithmic Complexity and Efficiency</strong>: Related to complexity theory, this topic focuses on analyzing algorithms to determine their efficiency and scalability. It involves understanding big O notation, time-space trade-offs, and the limits of algorithmic optimization.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reduction and Completeness</strong>: The course may cover reductions, a method for proving that problems are at least as hard as others, thereby establishing hardness and completeness within various complexity classes, particularly NP-completeness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Decidability and Recursion</strong>: An exploration of which problems can be algorithmically decided, the limits of algorithmic solutions, and how recursive functions play into the theory of computation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Quantum Computation (Optional)</strong>: Some courses might introduce elements of quantum computation, discussing how quantum bits and quantum algorithms could potentially solve problems more efficiently than classical algorithms.</p></li></ol><p>The course typically involves a mix of lectures, problem sets, theoretical exercises, and sometimes programming assignments to implement concepts algorithmically. It's rigorous and abstract, requiring a solid foundation in discrete mathematics, particularly in areas like set theory, logic, and graph theory.</p><br><br>3 homework assignments 11% of total grade each ( all three are worth 33.3% )<br><br>midterm is worth 33.3%<br><br>final is worth 33.3%<br><br>HW1 - due 02.22 worth 100pts<br>HW2 - due 04.15 worth 100pts<br>HW3 - due 05.01 worth 100pts<br><br>MIDTERM - 02.26 worth 33%<br>FINAL        - 05.06 worth 33%",No category provided,CONFIRMED,,6kl813t5p1487pti68hl2ed5t2@google.com,,,DISPLAY,0,0,"vRecur({'FREQ': ['WEEKLY'], 'WKST': ['SU'], 'UNTIL': [datetime.datetime(2024, 5, 10, 5, 59, 59, tzinfo=<UTC>)], 'BYDAY': ['MO', 'WE']})"
